			Late 2022 my siblings and I decided to take a siblings trip to Cancun. Cancun was one of the <i> most </i> peaceful trips I have ever taken. On our trip we went
			island exploring and took many ferry rides. We went ziplining, hiking, and even got the chance to drive around one of their islands in a cool cart. 
			While all this was fun, even the day we decided to stay on the island and do absolutely nothing but relax on the white sandy beach was amazing. I highly
			recommend Cancun to all travelers as it was a <strong>surreal</strong> experience.

			Another thing to note about Cancun is the food. The resort we stayed at had an unbelievable <i>unlimited</i> buffet that was to die for.
			The americanos, pina coladas, and tacos were incredibly yummy.

			I wish to visit Cancun again soon, and urge everyone who's been thinking about it to do it!
