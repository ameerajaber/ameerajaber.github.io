			Palestine is homeland, my soul, and my love. Growing up I'd visit Palestine every few years, and more recently I've been visiting almost yearly.
			The food, the culture, the people, it's all who I am and I couldn't be more grateful. From the moment I step foot in my homeland my heart is at peace.
			Every year I look forward to the first bite of the famous falafel food truck in the middle of my village, and a visit to Ramallah to shop for beautiful
			<i>thobes</i>. I also look forward to visiting Jerusalem although due to my Palestinian identity I am often denied access. I always look back through
			my camera at the few times I did make it to Jerusalem and yearn to be back and pray at the Dome of the Rock.

			Palestine, the country of the figs and the olive trees, is <i>the</i> most beautiful country and I urge everyone who has never heard of it, or who has
			heard the misinformation about it recently to research it. I yearn to be back in Palestine and here the beautiful sound of the athan from the local mosque
			and the laughter of children in the streets and the birds whistling at dawn. I love my country with all my heart. 
		</p>

			For anyone planning to visit Palestine, it is important to visit the glass factories in Al-Khalil, the candy shops in Jerusalem, the top of the city of Nablus,
			and the church in Betheleham. Every corner in Palestine holds a story and a memory, and no occupational forces could ever take that away. My heart beats for 
			Palestine.
