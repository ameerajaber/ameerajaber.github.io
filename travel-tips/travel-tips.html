		<h3> Ameera's Top 3 Travel Tips </h3>

		<dl>
			<dt><b>Don't overpack!</b></dt>
			<dd> Although it's hard to resist overpacking in fear of missing something, overpacking actually limits you. Reaching the weight goal of your
				suitcase means not having extra space to bring back souvenirs from your trip, and having to carry a ton of weight around with you. 
				The best way to avoid this is to make sure you make a list of the necessities and stick to it. Also, packing a capsule wardrobe is much
				more efficient than a ton of unrelated outfits.
			</dd>

			<dt><b>Keep the full size items in your check-in!</b></dt>
			<dd> The amount of times I've had full size items such as water bottles, spray deodorant, shampoo bottles and more tossed out is insane! Although not
				much of a <i>wow</i> travel tip, it's happened so often I had to include it. 
			</dd>

			<br>

			<dt><b>Make an Itinerary!</b></dt>
			<dd> Although it's nice to go with the flow most of the time, making an itinerary ensures you get the best of both worlds. Even if its just picking a city
				for the day, having a rough outline of what you're doing, especially when you're going to uncharted territories, is a lifesaver. Simple research 
				about the country you're going to can save you tons of time deciding on what to do when you're there.
