		<p> I feel like one of the most common states people wish to visit is California. While most people explore the popular cities such as LA and San Francisco,
			I decided to explore the smaller more homey, village-like cities such as Big Bear. While the drive was incredibly scary driving up the mountains, Big Bear
			City was an <i> unreal </i> experience. Similar to the village in Gilmore Girls, Big Bear was super cozy to walk through. Although the hikes were a little 
			beyond my comfort zone, reaching the top of the mountains was definitely worth it. 
			The sights in this city were crazy beautiful. One thing you can do in 
			Big Bear City is a helicopter tour where they show you a your of a large section of California. My sister and I did this tour and had so much fun!
			My favorite part of Big Bear City, however, was that they had a Ben & Jerry's shop in the middle of the village! As a big ice cream lover, this really appealed to me.
			I would definitely recommend Big Bear City to any person exploring the state of California.
