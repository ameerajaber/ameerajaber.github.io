			One of my more recent trips was to Colorado. An integral part of my everyday life is a scrumptious iced coffee, and Colorado's coffee <i>definitely</i>
			hit the spot. I tried <a href= "https://www.dutchbros.com/">dutch bros</a> for the very first time, and absolutely loved it. I also had the best 
			french toast that I still occasionally think about (if you can't tell by now I am a <i> huge </i> foodie!)

			While in Colorado I visited beautiful botanical gardens, went ziplining, and hiked a ton! The hikes in Colorado were almost <b> unmatched </b> as the
			scenery there is so beautiful. I did get stuck on the zipline (as I usually do), but it was a ton of fun zipping over this beautiful state.

			I also went to a quaint tea house and had tea time with a few friends. We then went on a train ride which is a must if you visit colorado.
			They have numerous train tours that stop at different sites and allow you to get down and explore
