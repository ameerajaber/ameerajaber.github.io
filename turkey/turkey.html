			Growing up I've watched my fair share of Turkish shows. Loving the culture and scenery through those shows, it was only fair I visit the country myself.
			It is safe to say the culture and scenery is absolutely <i>mind-boggling</i> in reality as well. From the architecture of the country to the ferry rides to
			the food to the generousity of the people, Turkey is a country I will never forget.
		</p>

		<p>
			Turkey is vast in its cities. I visited Istanbul as well as took a ferry ride from the European side to the Asian side. We also planned a trip to
			Cappadocia, but unfortunately it got cancelled due to weather. I do plan on returning and visiting Cappadocia and urge all travelers to look into it as well.

		<p>
			I recommend visiting the different mosques, especially the Hagia Sophia mosque, as well as the different palaces of rulers. I also highly recommend going 
			to a rooftop restaurant for breakfast as the views in the morning are incredible. Turkey, overall, was a great experience and I can't wait to go back!
